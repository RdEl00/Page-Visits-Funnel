# Page Visits Funnel
Cool T-Shirts Inc. has asked you to analyze data on visits to their website. Your job is to build a funnel, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process.

In this case, our funnel is going to describe the following process:

- A user visits CoolTShirts.com
- A user adds a t-shirt to their cart
- A user clicks “checkout”
- A user actually purchases a t-shirt

## Tables
- **visits** lists all of the users who have visited the website
- **cart** lists all of the users who have added a t-shirt to their cart
- **checkout** lists all of the users who have started the checkout
- **purchase** lists all of the users who have purchased a t-shirt
